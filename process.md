Initial goal-setting: Our initial idea was to make some sort of motion graphic. After some time thinking about cool graphic images that we could recreaete we decided to recreate a sunset. This idea overtime became creating both a sunrise and sunset.

Day 1: created a drawing to represent what we wanted to code. We also started by creating the background recatngles and the initial sun shape.

Day 2: We figured out how to make the sun move up and down and made the color gradient change with the position of the sun 

Day 3: We fixed how the colors change so that it resembles a sunset and sunrise. We also made little changes to how the ocean looked

Day 4: After meeting with Mr. Oswald, we figured out how to make the sun move in a more realistic elipse movement instead of up and down. 

Day 5: We figured out how to incoorporate an ocean image. We struggled with making the image cover the window width and decided to duplicate the photo. 

Reflections about what I've learned: I have learned that writing ideas out can make the coding process much easier. Trial and error can be fristrating when coding but taking things slowly and going through each line to find an error is helpful. I learned how to make a motion graphic and use various functions and equations to make the graphic move in along different paths. I also learned how to manipulate colors with different saturations and brightness levels and work with background images.
