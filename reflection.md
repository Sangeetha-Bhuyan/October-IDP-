The "six things" (variables, functions, conditionals, arrays, loops, objects): Variables were used to define specific parts of the motion graphic like the coordinates of movement. Loops were used to repeat the drawing of parts of the graphic. Conditionals were used to execute instrutions like the color of the sky based on where the sun is on the screen. Function were used to accomplish specific tasks within the whole project.

Revisions made: I did not make any recent revisions on the project, but when working on the project some of the main things I worked on were making the sun move in a way that resembles a true sunrise and sunset. Additionally, I tried to make the color of the sky similar to the actual color of the sky when it is rising or setting.

Things you know now that you didn't the first time:
I did not know how to create a moving graphic or use different equations to make an object move in different ways. This was the first project that I did where I came up with an image that I wanted my computer to make and was actually able to create it. I learned the imporatnce of drawing out initial ideas before actually trying to code.
